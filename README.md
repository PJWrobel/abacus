# The Abacus Programming Language
A fast, safe, compiled language for modern productivity goals
---
This is a work in progress in very early development. Ill be candid, its in the blueprint stage. It goes to say that future compatibility is not supported.

##Foreword
C trusts me. And in that trust, I find a rush diving into the abyss of possibilities. Every error my own, every segfault a lapse, every victory an accomplishment. I don't trust C, I trust rust. So rigid in its structure, thorough in its assessment, demanding in its outcome. Rust doesn't trust me, and why would it. We are the ones that are flawed. Somewhere between a sardine leaving its school and a donkey turning a mill is a language that gives that spice of life for the casual adrenaline junkie.

###Goals:
* Compiles to C: best option for C interop. Possible FFI however an updated linking syntax and inbuilt makefile builder would be all that is required.
* built-in strings: UTF-8 compliant
* structs, enums, and unions: No classes here, although each of these types are receiving modern amenities: methods, traits, associated types, and rich language-defined methods and fields for
* rich type system: generics, traits, algebraic types,
